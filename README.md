## ðŸ“„ Extended Description for the Report

This report outlines the security assessment and enhancement of a Node.js web application that features user authentication and session management. The project was conducted in multiple phases, beginning with a vulnerability assessment using both automated tools and manual testing techniques. Common web security issues such as XSS, missing security headers, and input validation flaws were identified early in the process.

Subsequent phases focused on implementing practical fixes to address these vulnerabilities. Enhancements included input sanitization using validation libraries, password hashing with bcrypt, secure session handling, HTTP header protection with Helmet.js, and rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Additional configurations like environment variable management and cross-origin request control (CORS) were also applied to align with production-grade security standards.

The final deliverables include code-level improvements, security documentation, and evidence of risk reduction validated through re-testing. This report serves as a comprehensive record of both the initial security gaps and the measures taken to remediate them, ensuring the application now follows established best practices for secure web development.

# Web Application Security Hardening Project

This project involved auditing and securing a Node.js web application with user login and registration functionality. The goal was to identify common vulnerabilities and apply code-level and configuration-level solutions to mitigate them.

## Features Secured

- Input validation and sanitization using `validator`
- Password hashing with `bcrypt`
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure HTTP headers using `helmet`
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration
- Brute-force protection via `express-rate-limit`
- Logging of security events using `winston`
- Secure configuration using `.env` environment variables

## Tools Used

- Node.js / Express
- MongoDB (optional; can run without DB)
- OWASP ZAP (for vulnerability scanning)
- Nmap (for basic local port scanning)
- Chrome Developer Tools (manual header inspection)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
cd yourrepo
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a `.env` File

```plaintext
PORT=5000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourappname
JWT_SECRET=your-very-secret-key
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Notes

* MongoDB is optional for demonstration/testing purposes
* Logging output will be saved in `security.log`
* Security headers can be viewed using browser DevTools or OWASP ZAP

## Summary

This project demonstrates how to take a vulnerable Node.js application and apply a range of security best practices to harden it against common web attacks, following OWASP guidelines and production-grade techniques.
